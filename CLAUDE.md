# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Claude Code tutorial repository (claude-code-tutorial) that appears to be focused on demonstrating Claude Code functionality. The repository is minimal and primarily serves as a learning/demonstration environment.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md` - Basic project description in Japanese, indicating this is a Claude Code tutorial
- Currently a minimal repository with no package.json, build scripts, or complex architecture

## Development Notes

This repository appears to be a fresh tutorial environment with minimal setup. There are no specific build, test, or lint commands configured at this time. The repository structure suggests it may be used for demonstrating Claude Code capabilities rather than active development of a complex application.

Since this is a tutorial repository, future instances should expect to potentially add files, examples, or demonstrations as requested by users learning Claude Code.
